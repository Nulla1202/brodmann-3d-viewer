BA2,BA2,"Brodmann Area 2 (BA2) is located in the postcentral gyrus of the parietal lobe, forming part of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). It is cytoarchitectonically distinct but often grouped with BA1 and BA3. Specifically, it is found in the rostral wall of the postcentral sulcus.","Brodmann Area 2 is primarily involved in the processing of somatosensory information, including proprioception (the sense of body position and movement), texture discrimination, and the perception of object size and shape. It integrates tactile and proprioceptive inputs to form a comprehensive understanding of objects and body position.","Specific characteristics for Delta waves (0.5-4Hz) in BA2 were not explicitly detailed in the search results, but generally, slow-wave activity (delta and theta bands) can be increased in certain pathological conditions or during deep sleep.","Specific characteristics for Theta waves (4-8Hz) in BA2 were not explicitly detailed in the search results, but generally, slow-wave activity (delta and theta bands) can be increased in certain pathological conditions or during internal focus, meditation, and memory processes.","In primary somatosensory cortex (including BA1-2), alpha rhythms show desynchronization during movement execution and observation. Rolandic alpha (mu) rhythm strength is inversely related to fMRI-BOLD signal in the postcentral cortex, indicating a 'resting state' when strong.","In primary somatosensory cortex (including BA1-2), beta rhythms show desynchronization during movement execution and observation. Rolandic beta rhythm strength is inversely related to fMRI-BOLD signal in the postcentral cortex, indicating a 'resting state' when strong.","In primary somatosensory cortex (including BA1-2), gamma rhythms are generated and modulated during action execution and observation. Action execution induces a major synchronization of gamma rhythms, especially in motor areas (BA4 and BA6), but also present in BA1-2, with higher amplitude during execution than observation. These rhythms are involved in distinguishing self-actions from observed actions.","BA2 is functionally connected with other primary somatosensory areas (BA1, BA3) and receives efference copies from motor areas. It shows functional connectivity with the motor cortex (M1) and cerebellum, which are critical for balance control. It also exhibits connections with the precentral gyrus (BA6) and anterior cingulate (BA32).","Lesions affecting the primary somatosensory cortex (including BA2) can result in sensory deficits such as agraphesthesia (inability to recognize writing on the skin), astereognosia (inability to identify objects by touch), hemihypesthesia (decreased sensation on one side of the body), and loss of proprioception. It can also lead to numbness, tingling, and partial sensory loss. BA2 activity differences have been observed in response to pressure stimuli on finger joints.",
BA3,BA3,"Brodmann Area 3 (BA3) is part of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), located in the postcentral gyrus within the parietal lobe. It is situated just on the other side of the central sulcus from the primary motor cortex, forming part of the sensorimotor cortex.","BA3 is a crucial component of the primary somatosensory cortex. Its primary functions include processing sensory information from the body, such as touch, temperature, pain, and proprioception (the sense of body position and movement). It is essential for sensory perception, including two-point discrimination. BA3 also plays an important role in fine motor control and motor learning by coordinating movement based on sensory input.","General EEG studies indicate delta waves (0.5-4Hz) are associated with deep sleep and unconscious states. While specific characteristics for BA3 are not extensively detailed in the provided sources, delta activity in the somatosensory cortex would typically reflect reduced cortical activity or pathological states.","General EEG studies indicate theta waves (4-8Hz) are associated with drowsiness, meditation, and memory processing. While specific characteristics for BA3 are not extensively detailed in the provided sources, theta activity in the somatosensory cortex would typically reflect states of reduced alertness or specific cognitive processing related to sensory input.","Primary somatosensory cortex (including BA3) exhibits alpha rhythm desynchronization during movement execution and observation. In resting state, central alpha rhythms are mainly localized in the primary somatosensory cortex. The alpha component of the mu rhythm is suppressed during movement observation, potentially linking action observation to action execution motor programs.","Primary somatosensory cortex (including BA3) exhibits beta rhythm desynchronization during movement execution and observation. In resting state, central beta rhythms are localized slightly more anteriorly than alpha rhythms. The beta component of the mu rhythm is suppressed during movement observation, potentially linking action observation to action execution motor programs.","Gamma rhythms (30-100Hz or more) in sensorimotor areas are generated and modulated during action execution and observation. While gamma rhythms are especially involved in action execution in motor areas (BA4 and BA6), their specific role and modulation within BA3 during sensory processing are less explicitly detailed in the provided sources, though they are generally associated with higher-level cognitive functions and sensory binding.","BA3 receives its main inputs from the thalamus, acting as a relay station for sensory information from the skin, muscles, and joints. It has strong reciprocal cortical connections with the primary motor cortex (M1) and other somatosensory brain regions. It works closely with the primary motor cortex as part of the sensorimotor cortex, sending feedback to motor areas for smooth and coordinated movements. It also connects with other Brodmann areas involved in higher-level processing.","Lesions or dysfunction in BA3 can lead to impairments in sensory perception, including touch, temperature, pain, and proprioception. Changes in BA3 activity are observed in various neurological conditions affecting sensory processing and motor control. Selective surgical ablations of S1 (including BA3) were historically used for intractable pain. Abnormal functional connectivity in the primary sensory network, which includes BA3, has been observed in conditions like Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).",
BA4,BA4,"Brodmann Area 4 (BA4), also known as the primary motor cortex (M1), is located in the posterior portion of the frontal lobe, specifically in the precentral gyrus. It occupies the anterior bank of the central sulcus and the posterior margin of the precentral gyrus. Cytoarchitecturally, it is characterized by prominent layers III and V, with giant pyramidal cells (Betz cells) in layer V.","BA4 controls voluntary movements, such as picking up objects or walking. It initiates and organizes voluntary movements, ensuring smooth muscle coordination. It also plays a role in planning and sequencing movements for coordinated and fluid actions. It controls movement on the contralateral side of the body (e.g., the left hemisphere controls the right side of the body).","Delta oscillatory rhythms are prominent in the motor cortex and are suggested to shape motor behaviors and sensorimotor processes. Decreases in cortical slow-wave activity (SWA), which includes delta waves, have been observed in BA4 during local sleep. Peaks in delta oscillations in the primary motor cortex can align with periods of increased gamma power.","While general characteristics of theta waves (associated with light sleep, deep meditation, and creativity) are known, specific characteristics or functional significance of theta waves within BA4 were not explicitly detailed in the reviewed literature.",Desynchronization in BA4 during both movement execution and observation. Higher amplitude desynchronization during execution.,Desynchronization in BA4 during both movement execution and observation. Higher amplitude desynchronization during execution.,Major synchronization in BA4 during action execution.,"BA4's primary output pathway is the corticospinal tract, with fibers descending to the spinal cord and synapsing directly on motor neurons for voluntary muscle control. It exhibits significant functional connectivity with other motor areas, including the premotor cortex (BA6), supplementary motor area (SMA), basal ganglia, and cerebellum, forming a complex network for motor planning, execution, and coordination.","Damage to BA4 typically results in contralateral paresis (weakness or partial paralysis), leading to loss of coordination and poor dexterity. It is implicated in neurological conditions like Parkinson's disease. Precise localization of BA4 is crucial for surgical planning and therapeutic interventions such as motor cortex stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).",
BA5,BA5,"Brodmann Area 5 (BA5) is a subdivision of the parietal cortex in the human brain. It is part of the superior parietal lobule and the postcentral gyrus, situated immediately posterior to the primary somatosensory cortex. It is cytoarchitecturally bounded by Brodmann areas 2, 7, 4, and 31.","BA5 is involved in somatosensory processing, movement, and association. Its functions include stereopsis, line bisection judgments, processing chaotic patterns, using spatial imagery in deductive reasoning, motor execution, bimanual manipulation, working memory, language processing, visuomotor attention, pain perception, tactile localization, and saccadic eye movement.","In the parietal area, higher Delta power was observed in patients with disorders of consciousness (VS/UWS).","In the parietal area, lower Theta power was observed in patients with disorders of consciousness (VS/UWS).","In the parietal area, lower Alpha power was observed in patients with disorders of consciousness (VS/UWS).","In the parietal area, lower Beta power was observed in patients with disorders of consciousness (VS/UWS).","High-frequency Gamma activity in the parietal area is considered relevant to consciousness, with parietal gamma activity potentially exceeding alpha in the deterioration of consciousness.","Area 5M (medial portion of BA5) exhibits broadly distributed projections from anterior parietal areas, primary motor cortex (M1), premotor cortex (PM), supplementary motor area (SMA), cortex on the medial wall, and posterior parietal areas 5L and 7b. It receives somatosensory inputs (primarily from area 2), posterior parietal, and motor cortex inputs, and provides proprioceptive information to area 5M.","Lesions in the left superior parietal lobe (including BA5) can lead to ideomotor apraxia (loss of ability to produce purposeful, skilled movements) and astereognosis (loss of ability to recognize objects by feeling or handling them).",
BA6,BA6,"Brodmann Area 6 (BA6) is a cytoarchitectonic region of the frontal lobe, located anterior to the primary motor cortex (Brodmann Area 4). It encompasses both the premotor cortex and the supplementary motor area (SMA). Characterized as an agranular region lacking a distinct layer IV, BA6 covers the anterior part of the precentral gyrus and extends to the superior and middle frontal gyri, as well as the medial surface of the superior frontal gyrus. It is distinguished from BA4 by the absence or scarcity of Betz cells, poor lamination, and the presence of larger, more densely packed pyramidal neurons in lower layer III. The mesial sector of BA6 comprises SMA proper (F3) and pre-SMA (F6).","BA6 plays a critical role in motor planning, sequencing, and control, with its primary function involving motor sequencing and movement planning. It is also involved in cognitive functions such as working memory. It is a higher-order motor area that mediates a transition from motor to cognitive functions. Subdivisions like SMA proper are associated with motor-related functions, while pre-SMA is associated with non-motor functions.","Slow wave activity (SWA) hotspots extend from BA6 to frontal (BA10) and parietal cortex. Slow waves have prominent foci in a precentral region corresponding approximately with BA6. Increased delta slow waves are linked to worsening PTSD symptoms over time in BA13, but specific characteristics for BA6 are not detailed in the provided snippets.","A study found higher theta activity in BA6 in mild depressed subjects. A cluster of 11 channels located over premotor cortex (BA6, 5 channels) and parietal cortex (BA7, 4 channels) showed theta waves in children's waking electroencephalogram. Over bilateral prefrontal cortex, theta activity peaked during the early part of the delay phase at 700ms in a study on auditory pattern working memory.","Movement execution and observation induce a desynchronization of alpha rhythms in BA6. WM-load related changes were also detected at alpha frequencies (10-14 Hz) in BA6, but did not covary with the number of relevant WM items.","Movement execution and observation induce a desynchronization of beta rhythms in BA6, generally higher in amplitude during execution. These features also distinguish Parkinson's disease patients on and off medication using non-invasive recordings in a study of beta (13–30 Hz) oscillations over sensorimotor cortex.",Action execution induces a major synchronization of gamma rhythms in BA4 and BA6. Gamma-band activity in human prefrontal cortex (including BA6) codes for working memory. WM-load related changes were also detected at gamma frequencies (30-100 Hz) in BA6.,"Posterior premotor areas (F2, F3, F4, F5) receive rich cortical projections from the parietal lobe and have direct access to the spinal cord and primary motor area. Anterior premotor areas (F6, F7) receive stronger input from prefrontal and cingulate cortices and send output only to the brainstem and other premotor areas. SMA proper is tightly coupled with movement generation and control, exhibiting direct connections to the primary motor cortex and spinal cord, and receiving input from the ventrolateral thalamus. Pre-SMA is linked to the caudate nucleus and anterior thalamus, and is strongly interconnected with prefrontal cortex, insula, superior frontal gyrus, and cingulate motor areas. Both SMA and pre-SMA receive input from spatially separate and neurochemically distinct regions of the cerebellum and basal ganglia.","Lesions in BA6 can result in motor deficits such as apraxia (inability to plan movements despite intact sensory and motor function), impaired serial movement parsing, paralysis, and impaired motor planning. Hypoactivation of BA6 is observed in Parkinson’s disease during executive function tasks. Disorders like alien hand syndrome and utilization behavior are associated with dysfunction of the mesial frontal lobe and fronto-striatal pathways, including pre-SMA and SMA within BA6. Abnormal tau phosphorylation in BA6 correlates with cognitive impairment and dementia severity. Speech disturbances (impaired speech initiation, aphemia) are attributed to lesions in the medial hemispheric part of BA6 (SMA). Exner’s area (part of BA6) is implicated in activating graphic motor codes for writing.",
BA7,BA7,"Brodmann Area 7 (BA7) is located in the superior parietal lobule (SPL) and the precuneus. It occupies most of the lateral superior parietal lobule and the medial precuneus. The precuneus is the portion of the superior parietal lobule on the medial surface of each brain hemisphere, located in front of the cuneus. BA7 is also considered part of the posterior parietal cortex.","Brodmann Area 7 (BA7) is a crucial part of the somatosensory association cortex. Its primary functions include: 1. Spatial Awareness and Object Localization: It is involved in locating objects in space and integrating visual and proprioceptive information to determine the relative position of objects. 2. Visuomotor Integration: BA7 plays a significant role in integrating multiple visuomotor programs for complex movements such as reaching, grasping, and bimanual coordination. 3. Motor Planning and Sequencing: It is also involved in the planning and sequencing of motor movements. 4. Visuo-spatial Attention: Right BA7 has been reported to activate in a specific manner in visuo-spatial attention tasks.","Delta waves (0.5-4Hz) are generally associated with deep sleep and certain brain dysfunctions when present during wakefulness. However, some research indicates that delta activity in the parietal lobe, including the superior parietal lobule (where BA7 is located), can be increased in conditions like hyperacusis. Additionally, delta power in the precuneus (part of BA7) during NREM sleep may reflect a decrease in waking-dependent processes.","Theta waves (4-8Hz) in the parietal cortex, including the superior parietal lobule (BA7) and the precuneus, are associated with several cognitive functions. These include working memory capacity, visuospatial attention, and conscious awareness. The precuneus, a part of BA7, has been shown to play a causal role in network-wide theta and gamma oscillatory activity during complex memory retrieval. Some studies also suggest that theta activity in the superior parietal lobe is involved in sensorimotor expertise.","Alpha waves (8-13Hz) are observed during relaxed, non-aroused states and are particularly prominent in the occipital and parietal regions. In the context of BA7 (superior parietal lobule and precuneus), parietal alpha oscillations are involved in attentional control, with stronger activity noted during easier tasks. Alpha-band phase synchrony in the upper alpha range positively correlates with activity in prefrontal and parietal regions. A decrease in alpha activity in the precuneus may indicate a release of inhibition linked to attentional demands. The superior parietal lobule also shows unique activation patterns in yoga practitioners.","Beta waves (13-30Hz) are observed in the parietal cortex, including the superior parietal lobule (BA7) and the precuneus, and are associated with active states such as attention, concentration, and motor performance. Beta traveling waves have been observed in the monkey parietal cortex, conveying information about rewards. Parietal beta oscillations are linked to visual crowding and are functionally relevant for cognitive performance. Decreases in beta activity have been noted in the superior parietal lobule. The precuneus, a component of BA7, is involved in various cognitive processes, and its activity can be influenced by beta oscillations.","Gamma waves (30-100Hz+) in the parietal cortex, including the superior parietal lobule (BA7) and the precuneus, are associated with high-level cognitive functions. Parietal gamma oscillations are modulated by cognitive reappraisal and are involved in the manipulation of visual and spatial information in working memory (especially high gamma, 80-100 Hz). The precuneus plays a causal role in network-wide theta and gamma oscillatory activity during complex memory retrieval. Gamma waves in the precuneus are also linked to self-awareness and visual imagery, with spikes observed during lucid dreaming. Dual transcranial electromagnetic stimulation can increase gamma oscillations and precuneus-hippocampus functional connectivity.","Brodmann Area 7 (BA7), encompassing the superior parietal lobule (SPL) and precuneus, exhibits extensive functional connectivity with other brain regions. It shows strong connections to somatosensory areas and is involved in integrating visual and somatosensory information. Functional connectivity studies indicate that BA7 can have increased connectivity with auditory cortices. The precuneus, a key component of BA7, connects highly with the inferior parietal lobule (IPL), the occipital cortex, other parts of the superior parietal lobule, and the dorsal premotor cortex. These connections facilitate its role in high-order cognitive functions by integrating multi-modal information.","Brodmann Area 7 (BA7), particularly its precuneus component, is implicated in several neurological and psychiatric conditions: 1. Alzheimer's Disease (AD): The precuneus is an early site for amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation, and task-related activity in this region is altered in AD patients. Decreases in synaptic markers have been observed in cortical areas, including BA7, in individuals with AD pathology. Research also explores the role of 5-HT7 receptors in BA7 in AD. 2. Huntington's Disease: The precuneus (BA7) exhibits Huntingtin inclusions, which are characteristic pathological markers of this neurodegenerative disorder. 3. Hyperacusis: Increased parietal circuit-breaker activity in the delta frequency band within the left superior parietal lobule (part of BA7) has been noted in individuals with hyperacusis. 4. Functional Neurological Disorders (FND): Alterations in self-processing brain networks, potentially involving BA7, are associated with adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) in children diagnosed with FND.",
BA8,BA8,"Brodmann Area 8 (BA8) is located in the frontal cortex of the human brain, specifically in the posterior part of the superior and middle frontal gyri. It lies anterior to Brodmann Area 6 (premotor cortex) and posterior to areas 9 and 46 (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). It includes the frontal eye fields (FEF) at the intersection of the precentral and superior frontal sulci. Cytoarchitecturally, BA8 is distinguished by a thin granular layer IV and clusters of large, intensely immunoreactive pyramidal cells in deep layers III and V.","BA8 is primarily involved in the control of voluntary conjugate eye movements, particularly saccades, through its frontal eye fields (FEF). It also plays a role in executive control processes, including working memory, selective attention, and top-down modulation of visual processing. Medial BA8 is involved in the explicit evaluation of emotional expressions and reasoning about mental states. It is also implicated in planning complex movements and possibly in the management of uncertainty or encoding hope.","An increase of delta power (0.5-4 Hz) in the right middle frontal gyrus (Brodmann Area 8) has been observed in overweight and obese patients with three or more food addiction symptoms during a resting state after tasting a chocolate milkshake. Generally, increased delta activity can be associated with deep sleep or certain pathological conditions.",Theta waves (4-8 Hz) in the frontal eye fields (FEF) show synchrony with the anterior cingulate cortex during sensorimotor mapping. The phase of theta oscillations (3-6 Hz) in the FEF is associated with temporal and spatial variation in working memory readout. Increased theta power in frontal regions can be linked to lower cognitive functioning and is observed in children with learning difficulties.,"Frontal eye fields (FEF), which are part of BA8, are causally involved in the attentional top-down control of anticipatory alpha power (8-12 Hz) in the contralateral visual cortex. Alpha oscillations support covert attention and are sensitive to creativity-related demands, showing increases at frontal and right parietal sites during creative ideation. Alpha waves are also associated with behavioral inhibition.","Beta waves (13-30 Hz) in the frontal eye fields (FEF) show synchrony with the anterior cingulate cortex during sensorimotor mapping. Increased beta activity can be associated with active concentration and mental engagement. High beta (above 20-38 Hz) is linked to complex thought, high anxiety, or great excitement.","The frontal eye fields (FEF) control attentional modulation of gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz or more) in the contralateral occipitoparietal cortex. Gamma oscillations are generally associated with higher-order cognitive functions, such as attention, perception, and problem-solving.","BA8 receives afferent inputs from limbic structures, visuo- and audiospatial areas, and the visual cortex. The primary thalamic input to BA8 arises from the ventral anterior nucleus, projecting to the anterior bank of the arcuate sulcus. BA8 receives input from the occipital and parietal lobes. The saccadic pathway from BA8 travels through the genu of the internal capsule, decussates at the upper pons, and synapses in the paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF). The frontal eye fields (FEF) within BA8 show prominent synchronization with the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in theta (3-9 Hz) and beta (12-30 Hz) frequency bands. FEF also controls attentional modulation of alpha and gamma oscillations in the contralateral occipitoparietal cortex.","Damage to BA8, such as from stroke, trauma, or infection, can cause tonic deviation of the eyes towards the side of the injury (gaze palsy). Seizure activity in BA8 can induce gaze deviation away from the affected hemisphere. Lesions in BA8 lead to deficits in spatial attention, characterized by abnormal eye movement patterns (loss of logical order, haphazard examination, gaze inertia) and spatial neglect. In schizophrenia, dysfunction of the right frontal eye field (BA8) is linked to abnormal eye movement patterns (longer saccades, shorter fixations), reflecting a more peripheral visual processing style and gaze discrimination deficits. Increased delta power in the right middle frontal gyrus (BA8) has been observed in overweight and obese patients with food addiction.",
BA9,BA9,"Brodmann Area 9 (BA9) is a cytoarchitecturally defined portion of the frontal cortex in the brain of humans and other primates. Its cytoarchitecture is referred to as granular due to the concentration of granule cells in layer IV. It contributes to the dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex. Specifically, it occupies the dorsal region of the lateral prefrontal cortex and extends medially to the paracingulate gyrus in humans and the cingulate gyrus in monkeys.","BA9 is involved in a wide range of cognitive functions, including memory coding, memory recall, working memory, executive control of behavior, verbal fluency, and inferential reasoning. It also plays a role in error detection, auditory verbal attention, evaluating recency, overriding automatic responses, inferring the intention of others, inferring deduction from spatial imagery, and attributing intention. In the left hemisphere, BA9 is partially responsible for working memory, empathy, idiom comprehension, and self-criticism, as well as processing pleasant and unpleasant emotional scenes and attending to negative emotions. In the right hemisphere, it is involved in the attribution of intention, theory of mind, working memory, spatial memory, recognition, recall, planning, calculation, religiosity, semantic and perceptual processing of odors, recognition of others' emotions, and attention to positive emotions.","Delta waves are typically associated with deep, dreamless sleep and unconscious bodily functions. In waking states, increased frontal delta power has been linked to psychological pain and certain pathological conditions. Given BA9's role in executive functions, abnormal delta activity might indicate dysfunction.","Theta waves are often observed during states of deep relaxation, meditation, and light sleep, as well as during memory retrieval and spatial navigation. Frontal midline theta rhythm (Fmθ) appears over medial frontal areas during cognitive tasks, suggesting a potential role in BA9-related functions like working memory and attention.","Alpha waves are prominent during relaxed wakefulness, particularly with closed eyes, and are associated with a state of calm and reduced mental effort. They are also linked to inhibitory control and attention. Changes in alpha wave power, particularly in the frontal regions, can be related to behavioral inhibition and depression, which might involve BA9 given its executive functions.","Beta waves are characteristic of an alert, actively thinking, and focused state. They are associated with active concentration, problem-solving, and decision-making. Given BA9's involvement in executive control and planning, beta activity is expected to be significant during the execution of these functions.","Gamma waves are the fastest brainwaves and are associated with high-level cognitive processing, learning, memory formation, and conscious perception. They are indicative of intense mental activity and information processing, which aligns with BA9's complex cognitive roles such as inferential reasoning and working memory.","Brodmann Area 9, as part of the prefrontal cortex, exhibits extensive connectivity with various other brain regions. It shows functional connectivity with subdivisions of Brodmann Area 8, particularly in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Structural connectivity studies have also shown connections between BA9 and Broca's area, as well as other frontal areas like BA6 (supplementary motor area and pre-SMA). Alterations in cortical structural connectivity in BA9 have been linked to lesions affecting memory and spatial imagery. BA9 is also part of broader functional networks, with brain regions simultaneously activated during cognitive processes forming large-scale networks.","Damage to BA9 can result in executive dysfunction, leading to problems with affection, social judgment, executive memory, abstract thinking, and intentionality. The area displays lower levels of energy consumption in individuals suffering from bipolar disorder. Abnormalities in DNA methylation and gene expression have been observed in BA9 in clinical disorders. Alterations in cortical structural connectivity in BA9 might result in lesions that affect memory, spatial imagery, and auditory processing. BA9 is also implicated in the pathophysiology of chronic schizophrenia, with decreased reelin expression observed in the left prefrontal cortex (BA9).",
BA10,BA10,"Brodmann Area 10 (BA10), also known as the frontopolar prefrontal cortex, rostrolateral prefrontal cortex, or anterior prefrontal cortex, is the anterior-most portion of the prefrontal cortex in the human brain. It occupies the most rostral portions of the superior frontal gyrus and the middle frontal gyrus. It is located underneath the air-filled frontal sinus of the skull [1]. BA10 is the largest cytoarchitectonic area in the human brain, making up approximately 1.2% of total brain volume [1]. It is characterized by a remarkably homogeneous appearance of its six cortical layers, with layer I being thin to medium, layer II thin with small granular and pyramidal cells, layer III being the widest, layer IV thin with clear borders, layer V wide with two sublayers (Va and Vb), and layer VI containing dark pyramidal and fusiform neurons [1]. It has the lowest neuron density among primate brains but features extensive dendritic arborization and high density of dendritic spines, suggesting its role in integrating inputs from multiple areas [1]. BA10 is divided into three sub-areas: 10p (frontal pole), 10m, and 10r (ventromedial prefrontal cortex), with gradual cytoarchitectural differences between them [1].","BA10 is involved in strategic processes in memory recall and various executive functions [1]. It plays a critical role in the collation, integration, and high-level processing of nociception and pain [2]. It is also implicated in self-referential processes, attention modulation, working memory, and decision-making [3]. BA10 is thought to control and manipulate event and time-based memory [1]. A role for rostral prefrontal cortex (BA10) has been proposed in multitasking, particularly in the selection and maintenance of higher-order internal goals [7].","Resting-state EEG delta power in the frontal region, including BA10, is associated with psychological pain, where less power correlates with greater pain [11]. In disorders of arousal, a subsequent increase of low delta power has been observed to spread over right and left prefrontal and left temporal cortices (including BA10) [14]. Patients with Major Depressive Disorder exhibit greater delta activity in L-BA10 and R-BA10 compared to healthy controls [9].","Theta band activity is closely related to memory, deep relaxation, and day-dreaming, facilitating the transition from wakefulness [15]. Intermittent theta burst stimulation over left BA10 has been shown to enhance virtual reality-based prospective memory in healthy aged subjects [17]. Patients with Major Depressive Disorder show lower theta activity in L-BA10 and R-BA10 compared to healthy controls [9]. Functional coupling between BA10 and hand muscle contraction during intentional and imitative motor acts can induce an excitatory theta/gamma ERS surrounded by a large inhibitory theta/gamma ERD (event-related desynchronization) in BA10 [16].","BA10 shows alpha activation during attention network tasks, with significant group effects in alpha source activity during the P300 interval observed in the Anterior Prefrontal Cortex (BA10) in conditions like Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) [10].",Studies indicate higher beta (beta3 and high-beta) activity in BA10 in patients with Major Depressive Disorder compared to healthy controls [9].,Neuronal oscillations in the gamma band are important for cognition [15]. Functional coupling between BA10 and hand muscle contraction during intentional and imitative motor acts can induce an excitatory theta/gamma ERS (event-related synchronization) in BA10 [16].,"BA10 has inputs and output connections primarily with other higher-order association cortex areas, particularly within the prefrontal cortex, with few connections to primary sensory or motor areas. Its connections through the extreme capsule link it to auditory and multisensory areas of the superior temporal sulcus and the ventral region of the insula. The cingulate fasciculus connects BA10 to the anterior, posterior cingulate cortex, and retrosplenial cortex. The uncinate fasciculus connects it with the amygdala, temporopolar proisocortex, and the anterior part of the superior temporal gyrus. It does not have connections to the parietal, occipital, or inferotemporal cortex [1]. This unique connectivity pattern suggests a major role in the highest level of information integration from visual, auditory, and somatic sensory systems, enabling amodal, abstract, conceptual interpretation of the environment, and influencing abstract information processing and the integration of multiple cognitive operations [1].","BA10 is an important node in neurofunctional systems responsible for self-referential processes, attention modulation, working memory, and decision-making [3]. Abnormalities in BA10 are associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder [4]. Changes in medial BA10 activation during future-thinking may serve as a neuromarker for successful depression treatments [6]. Lesions to right BA10 can impair real-world planning tasks due to difficulties in engaging problems [7]. Furthermore, BA10 shows dysregulated expression of neurotransmission-related genes in conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder [5, 12]. Reduced NREM slow wave activity in BA10 has been associated with Alzheimer's disease-relevant tauopathy [8]. Lesions to the left prefrontal cortex (including BA10) can lead to less entrenched beliefs and more skeptical reasoning [13].",

BA16,BA16,"Brodmann Area 16 (BA16) is a subdivision of the human insular cortex, also known as the insula or Island of Reil. It is a distinct lobe located deep inside the lateral sulcus of the Sylvian fissure, hidden by the frontal and temporal opercula. The insula is disproportionately increased in humans compared to macaques. It contains five to seven oblique gyri that converge inferiorly, giving a fan-like appearance. A central insular sulcus divides the lobe into an anterior and a posterior half. Cytoarchitectonics and myeloarchitectonics identify three major subdivisions in the insular cortex in humans and primates. BA16 is specifically mentioned as one of the Brodmann areas (13 to 16) that constitute the human insular cortex.","Brodmann Area 16 (BA16), as an integral part of the insular cortex, is implicated in a diverse array of functions encompassing sensory processing, motor control, and higher-order cognitive and emotional processes. In terms of **sensory processing**, BA16 is associated with visceral sensations and has been linked to sensory warnings experienced during seizures, often manifesting as a burning heat sensation localized around the mouth. Regarding **motor control**, stimulation of this area can induce pharyngeal symptoms, such as involuntary throat movements, and various motor symptoms including facial or upper limb spasms, head or eye rotation, and generalized dystonia. Furthermore, BA16 contributes significantly to **cognitive and emotional functions**. Functional neuroimaging studies have established its involvement in desires, cravings, and addiction. It also plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of several psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, mood disorders, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

These delta waves have been linked to worsening symptoms in conditions such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).","Research indicates that theta (~6–9 Hz) frequency oscillations are widespread and spontaneously present within the human insula, including the region encompassing BA16. These oscillations are largely organized along the anterior–posterior axis of the insula, with the left insula showing a posterior-to-anterior decreasing frequency gradient and an anterior-to-posterior decreasing power gradient in the theta band. Insular theta oscillations operate as traveling waves.","Studies on the human insula have explicitly noted an absence of 9–15 Hz oscillations, suggesting that typical alpha wave activity (8-13 Hz) is not a prominent feature of the insular cortex, including BA16. However, some research on the insular cortex has explored the modulation of alpha oscillations in response to painful stimuli, indicating that while not a dominant spontaneous rhythm, alpha activity can be influenced.","Beta (~15–32 Hz) frequency oscillations are widespread and spontaneously present within the human insula, including the region encompassing BA16. Both the left and right insula show anterior-to-posterior decreasing gradients for the power of oscillations in the beta frequency band. Insular beta oscillations also operate as traveling waves, uncoupled from theta waves in terms of phase and amplitude.","Specific information regarding gamma wave characteristics directly within BA16 is limited. However, the broader insular cortex is known to be involved in various sensory and cognitive processes where gamma oscillations often play a role in binding and information processing.

The anterior insula is primarily connected to the middle and inferior temporal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex, forming a network related to limbic regions involved in emotional aspects. The middle-posterior insula connects to premotor, sensorimotor, supplementary motor, and middle-posterior cingulate cortices, indicating its role in sensorimotor integration. These two major complementary networks, involving the ventral-anterior and dorsal-posterior insula, are partially lateralized. The salience network, associated with the ventral anterior insula, shows stronger connections with the anterior cingulate cortex on the right side and with the frontal cortex on the left side. The posterior network has stronger connections with the superior temporal cortex and the occipital cortex on the right side. These findings support the idea that the dorsal posterior insula is functionally connected to sensory areas, contributing to visceral sensation.","Brodmann Area 16 (BA16), as an integral part of the insular cortex, holds significant clinical relevance. It is notably implicated in: **Epilepsy:** The insula is a frequent site for seizure onset (insular epilepsy). Direct cortical stimulation (DCS) of the insula is used during epilepsy surgery for functional brain mapping and to localize epileptogenic zones. **Psychiatric and Neurological Disorders:** The insula demonstrates altered structure and function across various psychiatric conditions, including anxiety disorders (specific and social phobia), schizophrenia, mood disorders, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Its involvement underscores its role in emotional processing and interoception. **Neurodegenerative Diseases:** In conditions like Alzheimer's disease, the insular cortex undergoes substantial pathological changes. Pathology within the insula may predispose individuals to exaggerated blood pressure variability in Alzheimer's disease, highlighting its role in autonomic regulation. **Pain Perception:** The insular cortex plays a crucial role in both physiological and pathological pain processing, integrating sensory, emotional, and cognitive aspects of pain experience.",

BA28,BA28,"Brodmann Area 28 (BA28), also known as the area entorhinalis ventralis, is a subdivision of the cerebral cortex located on the medial aspect of the temporal lobe and constitutes a significant part of the entorhinal cortex (EC) [1, 2, 3]. In humans, BA28, along with Brodmann Area 34, collectively forms the entorhinal cortex [1]. It is situated in the mesial temporal lobe and serves as a crucial interface between the hippocampus and the neocortex [3]. Anatomically, it occupies the middle portion of the medial temporal region, including parts of the parahippocampal gyrus and gyrus ambiens [3]. Its boundaries are defined by the rhinal sulcus (anteriorly), the collateral sulcus (laterally), and it merges with the hippocampal formation (dorsomedially) [3]. The EC is organized into six layers, with distinctive features in BA28 including an unusually wide molecular layer (I), an external granular layer (II) containing nests of multipolar cells, and the absence of an internal granular layer (IV) [1]. It is further subdivided into lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) [4].","BA28, as part of the entorhinal cortex, plays a pivotal role in memory formation, spatial navigation, and sensory processing [2, 4]. It is essential for forming memories, acting as the primary pathway for sensory information to the hippocampal formation [2, 4]. The LEC is involved in object and contextual memory, while the MEC is specialized for spatial memory [4]. The MEC contains specialized neurons crucial for spatial representation and navigation, including grid cells, head direction cells, border cells, and conjunctive cells [4]. BA28 is also involved in processing the sense of smell, and lesions here can manifest as olfactory hallucinations [5]. It supports working memory, particularly in visuospatial tasks, and contributes to temporal association memory [4].",Delta waves (0.5-4Hz) are typically associated with deep sleep and certain pathological conditions. Independent delta rhythms have been observed in the entorhinal cortex [6]. Increased delta power can be localized in brain regions corresponding to Brodmann areas during certain cognitive conditions [7].,"Theta waves (4-8Hz) activity in the entorhinal cortex is strongly linked to memory processes and spatial navigation [4, 6]. It is particularly involved in day-dreaming and memory encoding [8]. Theta oscillations are a prominent feature of the entorhinal cortex, often seen in conjunction with gamma oscillations [9, 10]. Theta-burst microstimulation of the EC can enhance recognition memory [4].","Alpha waves are generally associated with a relaxed, wakeful state. While not specifically detailed for BA28, alpha waves are known to be related to behavioral inhibition and can be influenced by neurofeedback training [11, 12].","Beta waves are typically associated with active thinking, alertness, and concentration. The entorhinal cortex's activity contributes to overall brain states, but specific beta characteristics for BA28 are not distinctly highlighted in the provided sources.","Gamma oscillations (30-100Hz+) are observed in the entorhinal cortex, often in association with theta rhythms, and are implicated in cognitive function and information processing [4, 9, 10]. Slow gamma stimulation may impair memory encoding [4].","BA28, as the entorhinal cortex, is a major hub for information flow within the limbic system, particularly with the hippocampus and neocortex [3, 4]. It has intrinsic connectivity organized into three rostrocaudal bands (lateral, intermediate, medial) with strong interconnections within each band [4]. It receives afferent inputs from the perirhinal, postrhinal, and parahippocampal cortices, amygdala, thalamus, and olfactory structures, with the amygdala preferentially targeting the lateral EC [4]. It sends efferent projections to all hippocampal subfields (dentate gyrus, CA3, CA2, CA1, subiculum). Layer II neurons project radially, and layer III neurons project transversely. The lateral EC also sends efferents to subcortical structures like the amygdala, olfactory nuclei, and basal ganglia [4]. The hippocampal-entorhinal circuit is fundamental for episodic memory formation and consolidation [13]. Fiber density between the rhinal cortex (including BA28) and activated ventrolateral prefrontal regions predicts episodic memory performance [3].","The entorhinal cortex (BA28) is notably vulnerable in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. In Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), Layer II neurons in the EC are among the earliest affected, with neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and tau pathology appearing decades before amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition. Approximately 30% of EC neurons are lost by the mild cognitive impairment stage, and EC atrophy is a reliable biomarker for disease progression [4]. In Temporal Lobe Epilepsy, the EC exhibits hyperexcitability and interneuron loss, especially in layer III of the medial EC, contributing to seizure generation and propagation. Surgical removal of the EC is often necessary to control drug-resistant limbic seizures [4]. In Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder, neuronal migration disturbances, including disorganized and displaced layer II neurons, are observed in schizophrenia. Reduced densities of parvalbumin-positive interneurons and decreased microtubule-associated protein expression have been reported in both disorders, suggesting early neurodevelopmental disruptions affecting EC connectivity [4].",

Short-latency gamma-band oscillations have been found in the auditory potential within 100 ms from stimulus onset. Evoked gamma may reflect synchronously active neural assemblies or signal precise temporal relationships of incoming stimuli. Induced gamma may reflect object representation or activation of associative memories.,"BA41 has strong connections with the secondary auditory areas, specifically Brodmann Area 42 and Brodmann Area 22. These connections are often bidirectional. Functional connectivity can extend to other brain regions, including motor areas, and potentially Broca's area and higher-order extrastriate cortex (V3).","In Alzheimer's disease, the primary auditory cortex (BA41) appears to be relatively preserved, showing minimal pathological changes compared to auditory association areas like BA22. Individuals with congenital deafness lack auditory stimulation to the primary auditory cortex, leading to significant implications for auditory processing development. Patients with schizophrenia often exhibit lower performance on tasks dependent on primary auditory cortex function, suggesting its involvement in the pathology of the disorder. Dysfunction in BA41 can contribute to various auditory processing disorders, affecting the perception and interpretation of sound. The primary auditory cortex demonstrates significant neuroplasticity, meaning its structure and function can adapt in response to experience, training, or injury, which is crucial for rehabilitation efforts in auditory impairments.",

It forms robust links with lateral temporal cortex areas, crucial for speech processing in the left hemisphere. Subcortical connections include pathways to the basal ganglia, thalamus, and corticospinal tract, forming a cortico-thalamo-cortical circuitry proposed to subserve computational grammar. White matter pathways involve dorsal and ventral language streams: the dorsal pathway connects the superior temporal gyrus to BA44 via the arcuate fasciculus and superior longitudinal fasciculus (auditory-motor integration, higher-level language functions); the ventral pathway links BA45 and temporal cortex through the extreme capsule fiber system, and the uncinate fasciculus connects the frontal operculum with anterior superior temporal gyrus/sulcus. The arcuate fasciculus connects BA44 and Wernicke's area, facilitating speech production and reading aloud.","Lesions in BA44 are classically associated with Broca's aphasia, characterized by nonfluent, effortful, agrammatic, and telegraphic speech, poor naming, semantic and phonemic paraphasic errors, impaired repetition, and relatively spared comprehension.

While its precise role in semantic tasks is debated, some researchers suggest it subserves semantic retrieval or semantic working memory processes, guiding the recovery and evaluation of semantic information. Another view proposes that BA45 activation is needed only under controlled semantic retrieval when strong stimulus-stimulus associations are absent. Other researchers argue that BA45's role extends beyond semantics to all activities requiring the selection of task-relevant representations from among competing ones. Lesions of BA45 lead to expressive aphasia in individuals with left hemispheric dominance.","Research indicates that delta-theta rhythms between the ventral prefrontal (including BA44/45) and lateral premotor areas show greater functional connectivity during action execution compared to action observation.

BA46,BA46,"Brodmann area 46 (BA46) is part of the frontal cortex in the human brain, located between BA10 and BA45. It is also known as the middle frontal area 46, occupying approximately the middle third of the middle frontal gyrus and the middle portion of the inferior frontal gyrus. BA46 roughly corresponds with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Cytoarchitecturally, it is characterized by a granular structure with a prominent granular layer IV, differentiating it from adjacent areas like BA9 and BA10. It is bounded dorsally by granular frontal area 9, rostroventrally by frontopolar area 10, and caudally by triangular area 45.

Structural connectivity involves white matter fiber tracts crossing the corpus callosum to contralateral areas 9-46d and p9-47v. Functionally, BA46 is negatively correlated with Brodmann area 25, a connection relevant to the clinical efficacy of TMS in treating depression. There is also anatomically specific functional connectivity between left BA46 and left M1 during selection of motor tasks.","BA46 is implicated in the pathophysiology of several neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders.

A decrease in cerebral metabolic glucose in the right DLPFC (BA46) has been noted in treatment-resistant depression after vagus nerve stimulation. Damage to BA46 can impair short-term memory, inhibit responses, affect judgment of stimulus relevance, and cause organizational problems.

BA51,BA51,"In non-human species, Brodmann Area 51 is referred to as the Prepiriform area within the Olfactory region. It is described in species like Kinkajou, Rabbit, Ground Squirrel, and Hedgehog. In Hedgehog, it is expanded and subdivided into 51a, 51b, 51c, 51d [1]. In humans, the functionally equivalent Piriform Cortex is situated at the junction of the frontal and temporal lobes, medial to the temporal stem, lining the superior and inferior banks of the entorhinal sulcus. It is classified as part of the paleocortex, characterized by a three-layered allocortical organization. It is organized into anterior piriform cortex (APC) and posterior piriform cortex (PPC) and cytoarchitecturally comprises layer I (superficial plexiform), layer II (compact cell body layer), and layer III (deep pyramidal and multipolar cells) [3].","In non-human species, Brodmann Area 51 is primarily associated with olfaction, specifically as the Prepiriform area [1]. In humans, the functionally equivalent Piriform Cortex is a critical area for olfactory processing, recognized as the largest and most distinctive component of the primary olfactory cortex [3]. It plays a central role in processing olfactory information, synthesizing odorant features into perceptual odor objects. It is also involved in higher-order brain functions, including memory, due to its extensive connections with limbic structures. It is implicated in the representation of odor quality, identity, and hedonics [3].","During slow-wave sleep, anterior piriform cortex neurons show highly synchronized discharges that accompany olfactory cortex sharp waves (OC-SPWs) [7]. Slow-wave activity (SWA) is dominated by strong delta frequency power (1-4 Hz) and large slow waves at 1-2 Hz [7]. Anticipatory phase resetting in the piriform cortex improves perceptual accuracy [9].","Odor stimulation enhances theta waves in the piriform cortex in humans [10, 11]. Piriform oscillatory activity conveys olfactory-specific information, maximally within the theta frequency [5, 8].

It also receives inputs from the anterior olfactory nucleus, other olfactory cortical regions, and commissural fibers from the contralateral piriform cortex via the anterior commissure [3]. Efferent projections target the orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala (especially basolateral and anterior cortical nuclei), entorhinal cortex, mediodorsal thalamus, hypothalamus, and contralateral piriform cortex. Feedback projections to the olfactory bulb terminate on GABAergic granule cell interneurons [3]. Neuromodulatory inputs include acetylcholine from the horizontal limb of the diagonal band, norepinephrine from the locus coeruleus, serotonin from the raphe nucleus, and dopamine from the ventral tegmental area [3].
